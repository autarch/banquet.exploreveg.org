                    <p>
                      Please join us on Thursday, April 8, 2010, as
                      Compassionate Action for Animals celebrates advocating
                      for farm animals at our Sixth Annual CAA Banquet!

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Focusing on action, education, and outreach to inspire and
                    promote veganism, CAA touches hundreds of human lives and
                    saves thousands of animal lives. Through the dedicated
                    efforts of CAA volunteers, thousands of leaflets are
                    distributed to increase awareness of the plight of factory
                    farm animals, hundreds of individuals pledge to try
                    vegetarianism, social gatherings are held to bring
                    like-minded people together, and inspirational speakers
                    from across the country educate the public about those who
                    cannot speak for themselves.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The event begins with a reception featuring a selection of
                    delicious hors d'ouevres, and complimentary wine. During
                    the reception, we will also have a silent auction
                    featuring artwork, gift baskets, services from local
                    vendors, and more.
                  </p>

                    <h2>The Food</h2>

                    <p>
                      This year, our dinner features <strong>gourmet vegan
                      catering</strong> from Ciree Linsemann, Compassionate
                      Chef. The dinner will begin with bread and salad,
                      followed by a choice of soup and entree, all served with
                      your choice of wine or juice. After a brief presentation
                      by CAA, you will enjoy a decadent vegan dessert.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Because you have a choice of soups and entrees, this
                      year we are asking you to select your soup and entree in
                      advance when you purchase your ticket.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Note that <strong>all dishes are vegan</strong>. The
                      "cheddar" and "creme" in some dishes are not made from
                      dairy products.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Soups</h3>

                    <p>
                      After bread and salad, you will be served your choice of soup.
                    </p>
